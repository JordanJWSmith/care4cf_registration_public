# CARE4CF Registration

## Abstract
People with Cystic Fibrosis often spend around two hours each day on treatments to try and stay well. The most time-consuming of these treatments are airway clearance treatments, a form of chest physiotherapy. Many people with CF choose to replace airway clearance with exercise, and the CARE4CF trial aims to study whether people with CF can do so without getting sicker as a result. The CARE4CF App will be used by ~1,000 people with CF to log what airway clearance activities they do each day - whether theyâ€™ve done their normal routine, something different (and if so, what) or no activities. It is a progressive web app, using recent technologies to create an installable web app with offline functionality and push notifications.
