# care4cf_reg
This is a registration app for the CARE4CF trial. It is necessary to register before accessing the [CARE4CF logging app](https://care4cf.azurewebsites.net/). The logging app's repository can be found [here](https://github.com/JordanJWSmith/care4cf_app_public).

Sign in with your Microsoft credentials and register your details. These are saved in a private Azure database. 

This app is currently hosted [here](https://care4cf-register.azurewebsites.net/). Visiting the logging app without registering first will redirect you to the registration site.
